          <p>Pepe is tired of watching everyone play hot potato with the endless derivative Shiba Cum GM Elon Kishu Turbo Ass Floki Moon Inu coins. The Inu’s have had their day. It’s time for the most recognizable meme in the world to take his reign as king of the internet.</p>
          <p>Pepe is here to make memecoins great again. Launched stealth with no presale, zero taxes, LP burnt and contract renounced, $PEPE is a coin for the people, forever. Fueled by pure memetic power, let $PEPE show you the way.</p>
